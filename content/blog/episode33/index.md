In this episode, I interviewed Dr. Antentor Hinton Jr. Per his biosketch on his lab website, he is a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Department of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics in the Vanderbilt School of Medicine Basic Sciences at Vanderbilt University and a member of the Vanderbilt Diabetes Research and Training Center and the Ernest E. Just Early Career Investigator. 

Dr. Hinton’s laboratory has a strong commitment to diversity. Dr. Hinton has published 8 STEM education papers and 32 diversity, equity, inclusion, mentoring, and career development commentaries. Dr. Hinton is currently a national leader on matters related to diversity, equity, inclusion and mentoring. Some of Dr Hinton’s publications include Cell,2023 (First DEI cover article),Cell, 2022,Cell, 2020,EMBO, 2020 (a),EMBO2020 (b)Nature Biotechnology,2020,Trends in Cancer,2021,Trends in Biochemical Sciences, 2021,Trends in Biochemical Sciences2022,Cell Reports Medicine, 2021 (Shared 2nd Anniversary Cover),Cell Reports Medicine, 2022,Trends in Immunology 2022,Trends in Cell Biology 2022 (a),Trends in Cell Biology(b),Trends in Biochemical Sciences, 2022 (First DEI/career development cover article for a scientific journal),Trends in Plant Sciences, 2022 (Second DEI/Career development cover article for a scientific journal,Trends in Parasitology, 2022 (Third DEI/Career development cover article for a scientific journal),Trends in Chemistry, 2023 (Fourth DEI/Career Development cover article for a scientific journal) andTrends in Pharmacological Sciences, 2022 (First mentoring cover article for a scientific journal).

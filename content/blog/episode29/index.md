In this episode, I co-hosted Dr. Karolin Luger with Chinmay and Parth, the co-hosts of a partner podcast with From where does it STEM? called Biocast. Biocast is a biology podcast made to serve as a resource for anyone interested in biology: whether it be about recent breakthroughs in research, common topics, or even just a general interest, they hope to encourage people to explore the world of biology and help them delve deeper into the wonderful science of life itself.I hosted Karolin in a previous episode back in 2021, and this is the first time Iâ€™ve done a follow-up with a previous guest! If you forgot, she is a scientist at the University of Colorado, Boulder who solved the structure of the nucleosome using X-ray crystallography. More recently, she was awarded the 2023 World Laureates Association Prize in Life Sciences or Medicine.

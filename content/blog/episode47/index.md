In this episode, I interviewed Dr. Alondra Nelson, the ⁠Harold F. Linder Professor⁠ at the ⁠Institute for Advanced Study⁠ in Princeton, New Jersey.

Per her website:
Dr. Nelson was formerly deputy assistant to President Joe Biden and acting director of ⁠the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy⁠ (OSTP). In this role, she was the first African American and first woman of color to lead US science and technology policy. 

At OSTP, she spearheaded ⁠the development of the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights⁠, issued guidance to ⁠expand tax-payer access to federally-funded research⁠, served as an inaugural member of the Biden ⁠Cancer Cabinet⁠, strengthened ⁠evidence-based policymaking⁠, and galvanized a ⁠multisector strategy to advance equity and excellence in STEM⁠, among other accomplishments. Including her on the global list of "Ten People Who Shaped Science," ⁠Nature⁠ said of Nelson's OSTP tenure, “this social scientist made strides for equity, integrity and open access.” In 2023, she was named to the inaugural TIME100 list of the most influential people in the field of AI.

In 2024, Nelson was appointed by President Biden to the National Science Board, the body that establishes the policies of the National Science Foundation and advises Congress and the President. Alondra was also nominated by the White House, and appointed by United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, to serve on the UN High-Level Advisory Body on Artificial Intelligence.

She also helped lead academic and research strategy at Columbia University, where she was the inaugural Dean of Social Science and professor of sociology and gender studies. Dr. Nelson began her academic career on the faculty of Yale University, and there was recognized with the Poorvu Prize for interdisciplinary teaching excellence.

Dr. Nelson has held visiting professorships and fellowships at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science, the BIOS Centre at the London School of Economics, the Bayreuth Academy of Advanced African Studies, and the Bavarian American Academy. Her research has been supported by the Ford Foundation, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, the Heising-Simons Foundation, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, and the National Science Foundation.

Nelson has contributed to ⁠national policy discussions⁠ on ⁠inequality⁠ and on the social implications of new technologies, including ⁠artificial intelligence⁠, ⁠big data⁠, and ⁠human gene-editing⁠ in journals like Science. Her essays, reviews, and commentary have appeared in The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, Nature, Foreign Policy, CNN, NPR, BBC Radio, and PBS Newshour, among other venues.

She is an elected member of the ⁠National Academy of Medicine⁠ (NAM), the ⁠American Academy of Arts and Sciences⁠, the ⁠American Philosophical Society⁠, the Council on Foreign Relations, and an elected fellow of the ⁠American Association for the Advancement of Science⁠ and the ⁠American Academy of Political and Social Science⁠. Nelson was co-chair of the NAM ⁠Committee on Emerging Science, Technology, and Innovation⁠ and served as a member of the National Academies of Sciences ⁠Committee on Responsible Computing Research⁠.

She is the recipient of honorary degrees from Northeastern University, Rutgers University, and the City University of New York. Her honors also include the Stanford University Sage-CASBS Award, the MIT Morison Prize, the inaugural TUM Friedrich Schiedel Prize for Social Sciences and Technology, the EPIC Champion of Freedom Award, the Federation of American Scientists Public Service Award, and the Morals & Machines Prize.

Raised in Southern California, Dr. Nelson is a magna cum laude graduate of the University of California at San Diego, where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. She earned her PhD from New York University in 2003.

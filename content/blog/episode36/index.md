In this episode, guest co-host Rami Major and I interviewed Dr. Adriana Bankston. Per her website, she is an advocate for scientific research and innovation at the federal level. For close to a decade, Adriana has worked to nurture U.S. competitiveness in science and technology through a number of roles with universities, non-profits and scientific societies. Adriana works at the intersection of scientific research, higher education and STEM workforce development with a focus on science policy to advance our nation forward through evidence-based practices and empower the next generation to get involved.

As the incoming first-ever AAAS/ASGCT Congressional Policy Fellow⁠, Adriana will contribute to our nation’s advancement in science and technology by providing high-quality, science-based, independent guidance to federal policy makers on Capitol Hill starting fall 2024.

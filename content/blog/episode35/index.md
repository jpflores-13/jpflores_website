In this episode, I interviewed Dr. Pallav Kosuri. Per Pallav's website, he studied physics in college at KTH in Stockholm, Sweden (where he's from). As a PhD student in the lab of Julio Fernandez at Columbia University, he studied the mechanics of protein folding and discovered that we can modulate this process to alter the elasticity of muscles. He then moved to Harvard University as a postdoc in the lab of Xiaowei Zhuang, where he used DNA to invent and build nanosensors that make it possible to see molecular movements. Since starting his lab at the Salk Institute in 2021, he has been excited about building a diverse and thriving research community, while training future leaders in biophysics. When he's not in the lab, you can find him rock climbing, skiing, or learning to surf.

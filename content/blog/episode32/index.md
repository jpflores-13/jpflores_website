In this episode, I interviewed Dr. Crystal Schiller, a clinical psychologist specializing in women’s mental health. She studies how hormones trigger changes in mood over the course of the reproductive life span—during the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, postpartum, and the transition to menopause. 
She is also passionate about teaching others about the impact of hormones on mood and tools that have been scientifically shown to help.

  🌴 My name is JP Flores (he/him), and I am a PhD candidate in Bioinformatics & Computational Biology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 
  
  🔬 Currently, I study the role of 3D chromatin structure in response to environmental stress in the [Phanstiel Lab](http://phanstiel-lab.med.unc.edu/).
  
  🎓  I am a proud alum of Occidental College, a small liberal arts school in Los Angeles, CA.
  
  🐯 There, I played NCAA DIII baseball and majored in Cellular & Molecular Biology with a minor in Public Health. I also did research on the venom of fish-hunting cone snails! 
  
  ✊🏽 Although science is what I want to do for the rest of my career, I am extremely passionate about diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in STEM (DEIA) and empowering the next generation of scientists.
  
  🎶 Outside of lab, I am a HUGE fan of music. Here's what I've been listening to:

  title: From where does it STEM?
  description: |
    storytelling for the next generation of scientists.
    \
    \
      Studying STEM can be daunting, difficult, and inaccessible- especially to students in marginalized, underrepresented communities Prominent scientists seem to have something "innate"" which discourages students from pursuing STEM. However, there is more than meets the eye. In this podcast, I set out to capture stories of resilience, scientific journeys, and inspiration that have built and shaped many diverse scientists. We want to get down to the roots and ask the real question... from where does it STEM?

** No content below YAML for the blog _index. This file provides front matter for the listing page layout and sidebar content. It is also a branch bundle, and all settings under `cascade` provide front matter for all pages inside blog/. You may still override any of these by changing them in a page's front matter.**

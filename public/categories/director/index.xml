JP: Let&amp;rsquo;s do it.
JP: Yeah. So Hi, Dr. Panchanathan, welcome to the show. I&amp;rsquo;d love if you could share an autobiography, you know. Tell us where you were born. How would you describe your journey, getting to where you are now and then, let&amp;rsquo;s end it with what impact you wanna have once you&amp;rsquo;re done serving in your current role.</description>

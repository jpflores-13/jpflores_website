      <description>Everyone&amp;rsquo;s academic journey is different. Just ask Amanda Finn- an undergraduate at Cal State University, Long Beach. Her passion and love for research is rooted in Kinesiology, and she aspires to be a professor one day. She is a friend from home who I wish I was closer with in high school. I hope y&amp;rsquo;all enjoy her journey as much as I did!</description>
